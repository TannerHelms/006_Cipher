Grade Checkpoint #1 encoding

	1.All JOpts
	2.Executable Jar
	3.JOp - ask do you want to encode decode or crack?
	--Branch, right now we only have encode
	4. For encoding - ask for the plainText msg
	5. ask for key
	6.Display the encoded msg

Grade Checkpoint #2 decoding

1. All JOP's, executable jar (no scanner or syso)
2. Select decode, you enter the coded msg
3. Enter the key
4. Program decodes, JOP's the decoded msg
5. How?  When you encode you shift alpha to the right (add key); decode reverse that
-- shift alpha to the left (subtract key).  Easy! Sort of ... problem is the
-- z-wrap becomes the a-wrap.  How's that for an interesting challenge?!
6. Cracking grade req comes later ...


Grade Checkpoint #3 cracking (don't know the key)
